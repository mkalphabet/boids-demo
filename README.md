# Boids Demo

This project demonstrates the Boids algorithm, a classic model for simulating flocking behavior in birds. It's a simple yet fascinating example of emergent behavior, where individual agents (boids) follow a few basic rules and collectively create complex and realistic flocking patterns.

To run the demo, simply run `npm install --save three` to install. Then run `npx serve` and point your web browser to the address. You'll see a flock of boids moving around the screen, exhibiting cohesion, separation, and alignment behaviors.

This implementation is written in JavaScript.
